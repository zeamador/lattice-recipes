# Changes for 1.0 Release

## Requirements Changes

### Product Description

We updated the description of our tutorial, tooltips, front page, and FAQ to more accurately reflect our actual user documentation.

### Use Cases

Added use cases for searching personal recipes and deleting accounts. Updated the documentation of our validation and error messages to match the current behavior of our product. Added more detail about intentional side effects of major use cases.

### Postpartum Reflection

Added a reflection of entire development process. Includes anaylysis of changed schedule, risk assessment, team roles, and features.

## Design Changes

### Class Layout

The old behavior of MealFactory proved to be wildly ineffiecient, so we had to redesign our algorithm. Those changes have now been added to our documentation.

### Test Plan

Updated our testing plan to reflect how we actually ended up testing our product.

## Feedback Changes

### User Tests

Reformatted the user tests document and added the changes made after the Release Candidate.
