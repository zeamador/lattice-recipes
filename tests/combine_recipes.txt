Combining Recipes:

CASE 1: Combination should fail without the proper equipment
1. As a signed in user, edit your kitchen settings so that your number of
   burners equals zero
2. Upload a valid recipe with at least one step which specifies the
   Equipment field as "Burner"
3. Go to the newly added recipe's page and click "Add To Meal" in the upper
   right corner of the page, which will take you to the "Recipes In Your
   Meal" page
4. Click "Combine Recipes" and expect to be taken to the "Combined Recipes"
   page where you will see the error message:
       "Your recipes could not be combined because at least one of them
        requires a piece of kitchen equipment that you don't have."
