Searching for Recipes:

CASE 1: Users should be able to search for recipes by title or tag
1. As a signed in user, click "Add Recipe" in the menu bar
2. Upload a recipe with title "Black Forest Cake" and tag "Sweet"
3. Upload a recipe with title "Sweet BBQ Ribs" and tag "pork"
4. Upload a recipe with title "Control" and tag "Not, Found"
5. Search for "Sweet"
   Recipes from steps 2 and 3 should appear.

CASE 2: Searching should be case insensitive for tag and title
1. As a signed in user, click "Add Recipe" in the menu bar
2. Upload a recipe with title "Waffles" and tag "breakfast"
3. Upload a recipe with title "Pancakes" and tag "Breakfast"
4. Upload a recipe with title "breakfast burritos" and tag "yummy"
5. Upload a recipe with title "Breakfast Scramble" and tag "Eggs"
6. Upload a recipe with title "Control" and tag "Not, Found"
7. Search for "breakfast"
   Recipes steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 should appear.
8. Search for "Breakfast"
   Recipes steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 should appear.

CASE 3: Searching should include partial words
1. As a signed in user, click "Add Recipe" in the menu bar
2. Upload a recipe with title "Fruit Salad" and tag "watermelon"
3. Upload a recipe with title "Control" and tag "Not, Found"
4. Search for "melon"
   Recipe from step 2 should appear.

CASE 4: "My Recipes" searching should have same features as normal searching
1. Create a new account and click "Add Recipe" in the menu bar
2. Upload a recipe with title "Other" and tag "Sweet, breakfast, melon"
3. Log out, and back in as another user.
4. Repeat all tests outlined above using "My Recipes" search.

   never appears in a search list.
