  <h3>Report a Bug</h3>

  <p>Lattice is in beta right now, so we still have few kinks to work out.
    If you experience any unexpected behavior, or want to request new
    features, we would appreciate getting an email from you. When reporting a
    problem, please include an informative title, and answer the following
    questions in your description:</p>

    <p class="bug-description">
    What steps will reproduce the problem?<br />
    1.<br />
    2.<br />
    3.<br />
    <br />
    What incorrect behavior did you see?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    What browser (including version) are you using?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Please provide any additional information below.
    </p>

       target="_blank">here</a>.
