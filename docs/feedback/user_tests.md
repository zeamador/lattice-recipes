This user read all the information presented on him on each page. After logging in and being taken to the kitchen settings page, he was somewhat confused on about what it was and thought it was a confirmation page. After updating some of his kitchen information, he had trouble figuring out how to add a recipe. Once he found it he added tags easily and included multi-word tags, though he expected after reading the tooltip that there would be a list of precomputed tags to choose from. He went through the form sequentially, instinctively copied the ingredients directly and then reformated them after reading the tooltip. After looking over the Step information, he opened the Tutorial in a new tab. He didn't understand what the large decription box was for in each step, but looked through all the images in the Tutorial without reading the text. He didn't understand what out remove button did for steps and prereqs and wanted a tooltip on it, thinking it was trying to tell him he had an error. He made some mistakes in filling out steps involving breaking up steps, attention required, time requirements, and equipment selection. He didn't understand what prereqs were and didn't use them. When told to combine recipes he tried to hit the Combine Recipes button without adding recipes but fixed his own confusion by visiting the About page and used the Search feature. He tried the customize button but didn't interact with the page. He was confused by the graphical display of the schedule on the Meal Schedule page, but understood the text descriptions.

He realize to sign up before being asked. When making his recipe he made it secret, added ingredients in the wrong format without looking at the tool tip (which he refused to change after reading it), initially ignored attentiveness but filled it out after reading the tooltip,  and was initially confused by "Add Prereq". When changing his kitchen settings, he easily and quickly found them. When searching he went back to the home page and used the Search link there, instead of the Search on the main menu bar. Easily found the Tutorial when requested and liked the illustrations. During free testing he asked where to find all the recipes and said that it felt really easy to use.

User requested that the Add Prereq button should be smaller than other buttons and that the name should be changed to imply that the prereqs already exist and you're just adding connections with the other steps. User also thought that new users should be prompted to view the Tutorial before uploading their first recipe. Also wanted a notification on the Meal page about how to add additional recipes.

- Had user add a simple pasta recipe, then add it to her meal and combine

## Feedback
The user added a whole step from the source recipe to the form, even when the step should be divided. She said it would've been helpful to have a tip on the Add Recipe form to tell you to only create steps that require one equipement source. She made mistakes with using prereqs, but said the inputting was mostly intuitive. When looking at the meal, she found the colors confusing, but liked the display otherwise and liked that it scaled with time. For the Tutorial page she said it had too much text and she wouldn't read it all.

## Feedback
User did not read the home page. When adding a recipe she wanted the tooltip for tags to explain what they were for and for the description to have a tooltip. She found the difference between All and Some attention to be confusing and didn't include times on her steps. The immediate prereq tooltip she found super confusing and wanted a general tooltip next to the Add Prereq button. Afterwards she also wanted a way to copy recipes and then edit a new copy of it.
