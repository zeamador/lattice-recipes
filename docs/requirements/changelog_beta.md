# Changelog at Beta Release

## Product Description

Updated description of YumvY under the Alternatives heading. Add prerequisite steps to the list of required recipe input data under the Major Features heading.

## Process

Removed the link to our deprecated documentation site.

### Team Structure
Team structure updated with more specific roles adopted by team members. These roles differed significantly from planned roles because of the unexpected division of effort required between the various sections of the project. The algorithm turned out to be simpler than anticipated, and integration turned out to be much harder. We also decided to have a dedicated tester so that other developers could focus on these integration problems.

### Project Schedule
Updated to reflect the progress we actually made this week for our beta release. As our roles have changed somewhat, the schedule for the rest of the project divides labor differently than previously did. 

## Customer Meetings

We added the summaries of our recent customer meeting with Isaac and Team Poseidon.
