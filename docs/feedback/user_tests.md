This user read all of the text presented on him on most pages but skimmed text-heavy sections like the tutorial.

After logging in and being taken to the kitchen settings page, he was somewhat confused on about what it was. He thought it might be a confirmation page or some kind of prompt for additional information. He aimlessly updated some of his kitchen settings and then expressed confusion about how to add a recipe. It took him longer than expected to notice the menu bar. He eventually found it and clicked "Add Recipe". 

He went through the form sequentially, never skipping over an option. He didn't immediately notice the tooltips, but once he did he read through all of them. He added tags easily and included multi-word tags, though he expected after reading the tooltip that there would be a list of precomputed tags to choose from. He instinctively copy-pasted the ingredients from AllRecipes.

After looking over the advice under the Step heading, he opened the Tutorial page in a new tab. He focused on the pictures, but they seemed to clarify the process a lot. He glanced at the text and seemed to skim it, but didn't take the time to actually read it. After returning to the Add Recipe page he didn't understand what the large decription box was for in each step despite having looked through the tutorial. It seems he looked at it for a general idea of what he was doing, not the specifics of how to do it.

He thought the red "X" buttons for removing steps and prereqs might be remove buttons, but he wasn't sure. He hovered over it thinking a tooltip would appear to clarify. When a tooltip didn't pop up he worried that the button was actually an indication of an input error. He didn't try clicking on it because he was worried he would lose the data he had already inputted into the step. He eventually added a prereq to a step and tried clicking on the red "X" there, and observing itself behavior was clarifying. He made significant mistakes in filling out steps, including not breaking up large steps, not adding any prereqs, not selecting the oven as equipment for a preheat-the-oven step, and thinking "time" for the preheating-the-oven step was the time to just press the buttons on the oven. He didn't understand what prereqs were and didn't use them.

When told to combine recipes he found the View Meal button in the sidebar, which took him to his empty meal. He tried to hit the Combine Recipes button and got a little confused at the message that came up saying he needed to add recipes. He immediately decided to visit the About page for guidance. He saw the "How Do I Use It?" section and everything seemed to become much clearer to him after skimming it. He clicked on the Search button to find recipes, and added a couple to his meal. He either knew where to find the Add To Meal button from reading the About page, or it was obvious enough that he knew to click it. He tried the customize button and didn't express any confusion about the customize page, but didn't interact with it either. He was confused by the graphical display of the schedule on the Meal Schedule page, but understood the text descriptions. He tested the site before the timeline was added to the Meal Schedule page.

He realize to sign up before being asked. When making his recipe he made it secret, added ingredients in the wrong format without looking at the tool tip (which he refused to change after reading it), initially ignored attentiveness but filled it out after reading the tooltip,  and was initially confused by "Add Prereq". When changing his kitchen settings, he easily and quickly found them. When searching he went back to the home page and used the Search link there, instead of the Search on the main menu bar. Easily found the Tutorial when requested and liked the illustrations. During free testing he asked where to find all the recipes and said that it felt really easy to use.

User requested that the Add Prereq button should be smaller than other buttons and that the name should be changed to imply that the prereqs already exist and you're just adding connections with the other steps. User also thought that new users should be prompted to view the Tutorial before uploading their first recipe. Also wanted a notification on the Meal page about how to add additional recipes.

- Cooks regularly
- Used to reading recipes from cookbooks

## Tasks
- Had user add a simple pasta recipe
- Then add it to her meal and combine
- Also looked at tutorial

## Feedback
The user added a whole step from the source recipe to the form, even when the step should be divided. She said it would've been helpful to have a tip on the Add Recipe form to tell you to only create steps that require one equipement source. She made mistakes with using prereqs, but said the inputting was mostly intuitive. When looking at the meal, she found the colors confusing, but liked the display otherwise and liked that it scaled with time. For the Tutorial page she said it had too much text and she wouldn't read it all.

User did not read the home page. When adding a recipe she wanted the tooltip for tags to explain what they were for and for the description to have a tooltip. She found the difference between All and Some attention to be confusing and didn't include times on her steps. The immediate prereq tooltip she found super confusing and wanted a general tooltip next to the Add Prereq button. Afterwards she also wanted a way to copy recipes and then edit a new copy of it.

Zach's user said tutorial was too wordy and she would never actually read the text, this has been addressed.
