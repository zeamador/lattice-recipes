Jake's Notes:
  - Add Prereq button should be smaller than other buttons
  - Add Prereq is confusing name, should imply that the prereqs already exist
    and making a connection to other steps
  - Ask new users to view the tutorial when uploading recipes for first time
  - Should tell the users on the meal page how to add additional recipes
