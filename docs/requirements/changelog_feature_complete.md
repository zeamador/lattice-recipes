# Changelog at Feature Complete Release

Switched all documentation from pdfs, to markdown. Please check out Beta Release to view all older versions of our documentation as zipped pdfs.

## Product Description

Updated major and stretch features to relect the functionality we actually implemented.

## Use Cases

Use cases had not been modified since they were orginially written, so most of them had incorrect or incomplete information in them. Now all major Feature Complete Release use causes are not included in this document.

## Customer Meetings

Added information from our meetings this week with both Team Poseidon and Team Zeus.
