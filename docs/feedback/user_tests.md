# Jake's Notes:
  - Add Prereq button should be smaller than other buttons
  - Add Prereq is confusing name, should imply that the prereqs already exist
    and making a connection to other steps
  - Ask new users to view the tutorial when uploading recipes for first time
  - Should tell the users on the meal page how to add additional recipes

# Zach's Notes:
 - Had user add a simple pasta recipe, then add it to her meal and combine
 - Added a whole step from the source recipe to the form, even when the step should be divided
   - Said it would be helpful to have a tip on the input form saying to make recipe steps that each take a single resource
 - Didn't add prereq on a "combine ingredients and serve" when it needed to have one
 - Said it the input mostly seems intuitive
 - When looking at a meal schedule, she asked about the colors of the bars in the chart
 - Said she thought the meal schedule display was good, liked that it was scaled by step time
 - She looked at the tutorial page and said she would never read the text because there's too much of it
