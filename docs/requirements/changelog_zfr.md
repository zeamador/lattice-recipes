# Changelog at Zero Feature Release

All of documentation now reflects our name change from Parallel Cookbook to Lattice.

## Product Description

We updated our major and stretch features to reflect our current understanding of what about Lattice will be difficult. In particular, we moved scaling from a major feature to a stretch feature and made combining an arbitrary number recipes a major feature. We also removed the stretch feature of dynamic updates to our instructions. We no longer have any intention of doing that. The documentation section in our product description comes directly from our SDS. 

## Process

We updated every aspect of our software toolset. We are now using Ruby on Rails instead of Java frameworks. We are hosting our site on Heroku instead of AWS. Weâ€™ve switched from a Google code repository to a GitHub repository and have added automated testing through Travis. We have also decided not to use OpenID, because implementing user accounts ourselves actually appears to be simpler than trying to find tutorials for OpenID. We updated the group dynamics, schedule, and risk summary to match the information in our SDS.

## Use Cases

We edited the combination to more accurately reflect our current planned workflow.

## UI Diagrams
We included the computer generated UI diagrams that we made after our paper prototype instead of the handdrawn ones from our old SRS.

## Customer Meetings
We added the summaries of our recent customer meeting with Isaac and vendor meeting with AgreeMates.
