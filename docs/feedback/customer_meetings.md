# Customer Meetings

## 2014/05/29 Customer Meeting (Isaac)
Attendees: Zach Amador, Chris Chalmers, Sam Courts, Jake Nash, Nick Parker, Bessie Song

We discussed our Feature Complete Feedback with Isaac, specifically validation, case sanitation, and mandatory 1 minutes step times. We also asked for feedback on our tutorial page and meal schedule display. We've been having a fair amount of trouble getting prereqs displayed the way we would like, and Zach explained the challanges of this to Isaac. He suggested using AJAX, but noted that our current format is not overly problematic.

## 2014/05/23 Vendor Meeting (Team Zeus)
Attendees: Zach Amador, Chris Chalmers, Sam Courts, Jake Nash

We evaluated AgreeMate's beta release this week and filed 17 issues. During our vendor meeting, they showed us all the changes they made for the feature complete release. We were very impressed with how the site is coming along and were pleased to see that they had addressed nearly all of our concerns. The UI is clean, chores are much less confusing, they've added a history feature, and invalid input is no longer allowed. We are still a little confused by how they manage bills, but would be willing to use the site as is with our actual roommates.

## 2014/05/22 Customer Meeting (Team Poseidon)
Attendees: Chris Chalmers, Sam Courts, Bessie Song

We let Team Poseidon use our computers and attempt to upload recipes using our current UI. We took notes on what seemed challenging to them, any questions they asked, and things they did differently than we intended. We then asked them for general feedback on our UI. We used this information to add issues #105 - #112 and set priorities for our feature complete release.

## 2014/05/15 Customer Meeting (Isaac)
Attendees: Zach Amador, Chris Chalmers, Sam Courts, Jake Nash, Nick Parker, Bessie Song

We spent all of our meeting talking to Isaac about how to organize our documentation and what the requirements for the beta release are. We then showed Isaac what our beta release looks like right now.

## 2014/05/06 Customer Meeting (Team Poseidon)
Attendees: Sam Courts, Jake Nash, Chris Chalmers

We looked in detail at the recipe upload form with our customers and asked them what changes they would like to see. We also asked them about our current ideas for how to display a meal. This discussion is documented in great detail in our meeting minutes.

## 2014/05/02 Vendor Meeting (Team Zeus)
Attendees: Zach Amador, Jake Nash, Bessie Song, Sam Courts, Nick Parker

Team Zeus showed us their zero feature release for AgreeMates. We liked the layout and color scheme a lot, but there were obviously no features for us to test out. Nick requested that roommates’ pictures appear by their names to help new tenants learn names faster. We also talked about the confusion bill splitting had caused during the paper prototype and presentation in class. In particular, we requested that all bills past their due date and household purchases that have already been made be tallied in one place. We only want to know the net money owed between roommates. Future bills should be viewable, but not in the same table as past/current bills. We also told AgreeMates our ideal chore division feature. We would like to be able to add some number of roommates and some number of chores, set an occurrence rate (ex: once a week), and then have those roommates cycle through those chores. We don’t care about marking chores as completed. We are more interested in the calendar automatically updating each week.

## 2014/04/24 Customer Meeting (Isaac)
Attendees: Zach Amador, Chris Chalmers, Sam Courts, Nick Parker, Bessie Song

Isaac seemed happy with how our paper prototype had gone. We walked through our electronic prototypes together, and for the most part, things were clear to him. Isaac did recommend that we make some tooltips required reading since users tend not to look at documentation. We also showed Isaac our UML diagrams. We were fairly confused about what was required in these diagrams, but Isaac said we should just include as much information as was helpful. He also said it would be useful to produce a detailed diagram of our algorithm.

## 2014/04/11 Vendor Meeting (Team Zeus)
Attendees: Zach Amador, Jake Nash (Chris Chalmers was scheduled to attend but got sick)

Team Zeus presented us with UI mockups. We raised issues with several parts of their proposed project. We asked for details about how inviting roommates will work and whether you could invite people who do not have an account yet. We asked them how the chore tracking system will work (whether it would support recurring chores, whether you have to assign a person to a chore when you create it, and whether someone besides the assigned person mark that they did a chore instead) and asked if the list of completed chores would be stored forever or if they would be pruned when they got too old. We also asked for clarification about the components of the supply tracking feature, to make sure that we would be able to add arbitrary supplies, and that marking a supply as “running low” or “replenished” would be straightforward. We didn’t have any notable concerns with the bill-splitting feature, as their UI mockups made it fairly clear how it would work and we agreed with their decisions. When we asked about landlord support, they told us they had decided the Landlord View feature would be a stretch feature; we accepted this choice, as the feature seemed less essential to the value of the app than the others.

## 2014/04/10 Customer Meetings (Team Poseidon and Isaac)
Attendees: Zach Amador, Chris Chalmers, Sam Courts, Jake Nash, Nick Parker, Bessie Song

When meeting with Team Poseidon, they brought up ideas about making the app easier and faster to use. One idea they had was to have an option to provide more detail for each step when inputting recipes. Another idea they had was to provide scaling options for recipes, i.e., to multiply the given quantities for ingredients by the number of servings desired. Finally, they suggested an option to mark completed steps and have the app recalculate the combination of recipes. This would be useful when the user misses a step or takes too long on one step. When meeting with Isaac, he brought up multiple useful ideas. One idea he had was to make a printable version for use in the kitchen. Another idea he had was to provide user accounts and have the app support private recipes that would only be viewable to the user that uploaded them. Isaac also mentioned that he would be willing to use the app if it saved him at least 10 minutes of cooking time, and that he would be willing to spend a couple of hours of up-front time entering all of his recipes into the app if it would save him time in the long run.
