Actually read all of the home page information. Seems to read most of the information whenever a new 

page loads. Outlier?

Seems confused that after login he’s been taken to the kitchen settings page. “Why is it presenting…?” 

“No information about what I’m trying to do.” Thought he was on a confirmation page or something. 

Need a header that indicates you’re on the profile page.

Updated kitchen for funsies. Can’t tell that updating kitchen settings worked.

Seems to think that he needs to interact with every element on the profile page after logging in – can’t 

find add recipes button. Maybe need a helpful “these are the things you can do” section after logging 

in?

Used tags instinctively.

Added multi-word tags.

After reading tag tooltip – expected list of good tags to use instead of free-form input

Accessing each form element sequentially.

Instinctively copies the entire list of ingredients from AllRecipes into the ingredient input field

Didn’t read tooltips at first but saw them and went through each one.

After reading the info under the Steps title, opened the tutorial in a new tab.

Doesn’t know what to put in the big textbox for each step.
# Chris

Doesn’t read the tutorial text, just looks at the image. Maybe does a little skimming.

“What does the little x mean” we need a tooltip on that. He’s confused. Thinks it’s indicating an error

**Doesn’t break apart steps from all-recipes, just copies the whole step description, despite reading the 

text under the Steps title. Says a step including preheating and lining a baking sheet and a couple other 

things is “some” attention.

Doesn’t select oven from equipment list.

“What’s a prereq?” Reads the tooltip, seems a little hesitant.

Tries a decimal number of minutes.

Adds the footnotes from AllRecipes to the notes section.

Tried to leave time empty because he didn’t know how long it would take.

I explicitly told him how to properly divide steps and told him to try again,

Thinks preheating the oven takes as long as it take to press the buttons – doesn’t think about the time it 

takes to complete. Says it takes no attention anyway

Says beating eggwhites takes some attention.

Asked him to combine recipes that he didn’t upload.

Tries to hit combine before adding recipes to meal. Confused by the error.

Goes to the About page when confused, finds the “how do I use it” section and becomes un-confused. 

Uses the search feature.

Tries the customize button, doesn’t interact with the page.

Very confused about the meal schedule page, not sure what the bars mean. Understands that the list 

of steps is all of the recipe steps. NEED to add a timeline to the side of the graph. Confused about color-
coding (we’re going to fix that). 

Didn’t understand what prereqs were – just didn’t add any.


# User testing – Bessie

Background: 

- Use a lot of online apps

- Chinese

- Student in UW

Task:

I. Add Recipe

- Realize to sign up before I ask him to

- Make his recipe secret

- Type in ingredients in wrong format without looking at the question mark

- Refuse to change it after he saw the format description

- Didn’t see the attentiveness

- After noticing it, he read the explanation in the question mark and understand it

- Seems really confused at “add prereq”, but realized what that is in 3 seconds

- Read the explanation of immediate prereq and preheat prereq

II. Add to meal, change kitchen settings, customize and combine meal

- Did everything as expected

- Looked for kitchen settings for 3 seconds

III. Search and Your Recipes

- Instead of clicking on the search button, clicked on “Home” then clicked on “search” in the 

welcome page

- Tried to search words in the steps and realized should search for title and tags

IV. Tutorial

- Found tutorial page immediately and really like the illustration

Free testing:

- Asked where to see all recipes

- Felt pretty easy to use

# Jake's Notes:
  - Add Prereq button should be smaller than other buttons
  - Add Prereq is confusing name, should imply that the prereqs already exist
    and making a connection to other steps
  - Ask new users to view the tutorial when uploading recipes for first time
  - Should tell the users on the meal page how to add additional recipes

# Zach's Notes:
 - Had user add a simple pasta recipe, then add it to her meal and combine
 - Added a whole step from the source recipe to the form, even when the step should be divided
   - Said it would be helpful to have a tip on the input form saying to make recipe steps that each take a single resource
 - Didn't add prereq on a "combine ingredients and serve" when it needed to have one
 - Said it the input mostly seems intuitive
 - When looking at a meal schedule, she asked about the colors of the bars in the chart
 - Said she thought the meal schedule display was good, liked that it was scaled by step time
 - She looked at the tutorial page and said she would never read the text because there's too much of it
