# Changes for Feature Complete Release

Switched all documentation from pdfs, to markdown. Please check out Beta Release to view all older versions of our documentation as zipped pdfs.

## Requirements Changes

### Product Description

Updated major and stretch features to relect the functionality we actually implemented.

### Process

Schedule updated to reflect current progress.

### Use Cases

Use cases had not been modified since they were orginially written, so most of them had incorrect or incomplete information in them. Now all major Feature Complete Release functionality is accurately documented.

### Customer Meetings

Added information from our meetings this week with both Team Poseidon and Team Zeus.
